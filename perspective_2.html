                    <h2 style="color: #EDFFEC;"> LABOUR LAWS IN INDIA</h2>


<p style="color: #EDFFEC;">Elaborating the benefits of the new labour codes, Shri Gangwar informed the House that the entire work force of the country will now be entitled for obtaining benefits under different codes. Minister mentioned the salient features of the 3 Codes which were passed by the Lok Sabha, as under :-
</p><h2 style="color: #EDFFEC;">(A) Social Security Code, 2020<br><br></h2>
    <p style="color:#EDFFEC;">Extending the reach of ESIC: Effort have been made to provide right
    to health security under ESIC to maximum possible workers:-<br>
    (a) The facility of ESIC would now be provided in all 740 districts. At present, this facility is being given in 566 districts only.<br>
    (b) Establishments working in hazardous sectors would mandatorily be linked with ESIC, even if there is only one worker working in it.<br>
    (c) Provision for making scheme for linking unorganised sector and Gig workers with ESIC.<br>
    (d) Option to link workers working in Plantations is being given to Plantation owners.<br>
    (e) Option for becoming member of ESIC is also being given to establishments with less than 10 workers.<br>
    Extending the reach of EPFO :
    (<br>a) EPFO’s coverage would be applicable on all establishments having 20 workers. At present, it was applicable only on establishments included in the Schedule.
    <br><br>-7-
    (b) Option to join EPFO is also being given to establishments having less than 20 workers.
    (c) Schemes would be formulated for bringing workers coming under the category of ‘Self-employed’ or falling under any other category under the aegis of EPFO.<br>
    
    <br>-8-
     Provision has been made to formulate various schemes for providing comprehensive social security to workers in unorganised sector. A “Social Security Fund” will be created on the financial side in order to implement these schemes.<br>
    Work to bring newer forms of employment created with the changing technology like “platform worker or gig worker” into the ambit of social security has been done in the Social Security Code. India is one of the few countries where this unprecedented step to bring workers in this category under social security has been taken.<br>
     Provision for Gratuity has been made for Fixed Term Employee and there would not be any condition for minimum service period for this. For the first time, a Fixed Term Employee working for a determined period on contract has been given the right of social security like a Regular Employee.<br>
     With the aim of making a national database for unorganised sector workers, registration of all these workers would be done on an online portal and this registration would be done on the basis of Self Certification through a simple procedure. It would facilitate the extension of benefits of various social security schemes to beneficiaries in the unorganised sector. We can say that we would be able to get ‘Targeted Delivery” of social security done to unorganised sector workers with the help of this database.<br>
     The most important thing for getting employment is the information about job vacancies. With this aim, it has been made mandatory for all establishments with 20 or more workers to report the vacancy position in their establishments. This information would be given on online portal.<br><br>
    
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #EDFFEC;">(B) Occupational Safety, Health & Working Conditions Code, 2020<br><br></h2>
    <p> Free health checkup once a year by the employer for workers which are more than a certain age.<br>
     Legal right for getting Appointment Letter given to workers for the first time.<br>
     Cine Workers have been designated as Audio Visual Worker, so that more and more workers get covered under the OSH code. Earlier, this security was being given to artists working in films only.<br></p>
    <h2 style="color: #EDFFEC;">(C) Industrial Relations Code, 2020<br></h2>
    <p style="color: #EDFFEC;">Efforts made by the Government for quickly resolving disputes of the workers :<br>
    (a) Provision for two members instead of one member in the Industrial Tribunal. In case of absence of one member, work can still be undertaken smoothly.<br>
    (b) Provision for taking the matter straight to the Tribunal in case the dispute is not resolved at conciliation stage. At present, the case is refered to the Tribunal by the appropriate Government.<br>
    (c) Implementation of award in 30 days after Tribunal award.<br>
    (d) After recognition of Fixed Term Employment, workers will get the option of Fixed Term Employment instead of contract labour. Under this, they would get benefits of hours of work, salary, social security and other welfare benefits like a Regular Employee.<br>
    (e) With the objective of better and effective participation of Trade Unions, a provision for “Negotiating Union” and “Negotiating<br>
    <br>-10-
    
    Council” has been made for undertaking negotiation on any dispute. With conferring of this recognition, resolving disputes through dialogue would be facilitated and workers would be better able to get their rights.<br><br>
    (f) Arrangement for going to the Tribunal has been made for resolving disputes arising between Trade Unions. Less time would be required for resolving their disputes.<br><br>
    (g) Provision has been made for giving recognition to Trade Unions at Central and State level. This recognition has been given in the labour laws for the first time and after this recognition, Trade Unions would be able to contribute more affirmatively and more effectively at the Central and State level.<br><br>
    (h) Provision for RE-Skilling fund has been made in the law for the first time. Its aim would be to re-skill those workers who have been fired from their jobs, so that they are easily able to get employment again. For this, workers would be given 15 days salary within a period of 45 days.<br><br></p>
