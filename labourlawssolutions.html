                        <b>Provident Fund :</b><br>
                        Employees’ Provident Fund is a social security scheme that helps employees save a small portion of their salary for future benefits.


                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Every company has to offer its employees an EPF or Employees Provident Fund which is akin to a retirement fund. EPF comes under the purview of the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. EPF registration is mandatory for organizations with total employee strength more than 20. Such employers can opt for online PF registration from Lawgicals. Companies can register for employee provident fund, in 3 easy steps:<br><br>

                        <b>To be eligible for PF Registration, an organization has to fulfill the following criteria:</b><br><br>
                        A factory with the total employee strength of 20 or more.<br>
                        An establishment that employs more than 20 persons. Here, the Central Government defines the class of such firms.<br>
                        An establishment that has less than 20 workers and has been notified of compulsory registration for not less than 2 months.<br>
                        Companies with less than 20 employees (Note: Such companies must issue a notice to the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization in 2 months or less than that)<br>
                        The employer and the employees of an establishment must mutually agree to apply for PF to the Central PF Commissioner. A notification has to be sent to the Official Gazette from the date of the agreement.<br><br>

                        Every employee is eligible for PF right from the beginning of his employment. The responsibility of PF contribution and deduction is of the employer’s

                        <br><br><b>ESI:</b><br>

                        Employees' State Insurance (abbreviated as ESI) is a self-financing social security and health insurance scheme for Indian workers. The fund is managed by the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) according to rules and regulations stipulated in the ESI Act 1948.<br><br>
                        <b>Applicability of ESI Scheme</b><br><br>
                        As per section 2(12) of the ESI act, all factories where 10 or more persons are employed must be registered under the ESI act. In other words, the ESI scheme applies to factories that employ 10 or more persons.
                        Furthermore, the ESI scheme applies to the following establishments, which employ 10 or more persons. These include:<br>
                        Shops<br>
                        Hotels or restaurants not engaged in any manufacturing activity, but are engaged only in sales<br>
                        Cinemas which also include preview theaters<br>
                        Road motor transport establishments<br>
                        Newspaper establishments (that is not covered as factory under section 2(12) of the ESI act)<br>
                        Private educational institutions (those run by individuals, trustees, societies or other organizations) and Medical Institutions (including Corporate, Joint Sector, trust, charitable, and private ownership hospitals, nursing homes, diagnostic centers, pathological labs)<br><br>
                        Thus, the total number of employees needed for a factory to be registered under ESI Act is 10 for factories all over India. However, the number of employees for an establishment to be registered in India are 10 or 20 as per the station.<br>

                        <b>Occupational Health Legislation in India</b><br><br>
                        There are presently 16 laws related to working hours, conditions at work and employment. There are two acts containing the main provisions for legal measures for the protection of health and safety of workers; they are the Factories Act (1948) and the Mines Act (1952). The Factories Act was amended in 1987 and stipulates pre-employment examination as a pre-placement procedure, statutory periodic medical examination for job in hazardous areas. In India, occupational health is under two ministries: 1) Labour and 2) Health and Family Welfare. The Ministry of Labour and the labour departments of the states and union territories are mainly responsible for health and safety of workers. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for providing health and medical care to workers through its facilities. The DGMS (Directorate General of Mines Safety) and the DGFASLI (Directorate General – Factory Advisory Services and Labour Institutes) assist the Ministry in technical aspects of occupational health and safety in mines, ports and factories respectively.
                        Constitutional Provisions<br><br>
                        There are three articles for ensuring workers’ safety and health. Article 24 prohibits employment of children under the age of 14 years. Article 39 (e and f) states that the health of men, women and children should be protected, and children should be given opportunity and facility for healthy development and should be protected against exploitation. Article 42 states that humane conditions at work and maternity relief should be provided.<br><br>

                        The <b>Minimum Wages Act</b> 1948 is an Act of Parliament concerning Indian labour law that sets the minimum wages that must be paid to skilled and unskilled labours. ... India introduced the Minimum Wages Act in 1948, giving both the Central government and State government jurisdiction in fixing wages.
