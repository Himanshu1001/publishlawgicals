<p style="color: #EDFFEC;">The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (‘New Act’) received the assent of the President of India and was published in the official gazette on 9th August 2019. This New Act will replace the old Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (‘Old Act’). The New Act will come into force on such a date as the Central Government may so notify.<br><br>
    The New Act is an Act to provide for protection of the interests of consumers and for the said purpose, to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers’ disputes and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. The New Act aims at strengthening consumer rights and protecting consumer interests, and further lays down simpler procedures to give consumers a speedy redressal. The Act also brings under its jurisdiction, the e- commerce and the tele-shopping industry.<br><br>
    Save as otherwise expressly provided by the Central Government, by notification, the New Act shall apply to all goods and services.<br><br>
    Now, recently, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (3) of section 1 of the New Act, MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (Department of Consumer Affairs) has issued a Notification No. S.O. 2351(E) dated 15th July 2020 (‘the Said Notification’) whereby the Central Government has appointed the 20th day of July, 2020 as the date on which the following provisions of the said Act shall come into force.<br><br>
    Chapter IV [Sections 28 to 73 (both inclusive); Except sub-clause (iv) of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 58.] has been notified by the said Notification.<br><br>
    Chapter IV deals with ‘Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission’.<br><br>
    Now, we would like to try and deal herein only Chapter IV of the New Act. The rest of the provisions of the New Act may come in our next session.<br><br>
    Section 9 of the Old Act established three different authorities at three different levels to regulate and resolve matters related to consumers namely:<br><br>
    National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission to be known as ‘National Commission’.<br><br>
    State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission to be known as ‘State Commission’.<br><br>
    District Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission to be known as ‘District Forum’.<br><br>
    Now under New Act, the District Forum is renamed as ‘District Commission’. <br><br>
    PECUNIARY LIMIT UNDER NEW ACT AND OLD ACT: – <br><br>
    ‘DISTRICT COMMISSION’: Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the District Commission shall have jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services paid as consideration does not exceed one crore rupees [Section 34 of the New Act].<br><br>
    Whereas, subject to the other provisions of this Act, the District Forum shall have jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the compensation, if any, claimed does not exceed rupees twenty lakhs [Section 11 of the old Act].  <br><br>

    Whereas, subject to the other provisions of this Act, the National Commission shall have jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and compensation, if any, claimed, exceeds rupees one crore [Section 21 of the Old Act].
    THE LIMITATION PERIOD FOR FILING OF APPEAL TO STATE COMMISSION IS INCREASED FROM 30 DAYS TO 45 DAYS.<br><br>
    Any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Commission may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission on the grounds of facts or law within a period of forty-five days from the date of the order, in such form and manner, as may be prescribed [Section 41 of the New Act] <br><br>
    Whereas, pursuant to the provisions of Section 15 of the Old Act, any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Forum may prefer an appeal against such order to the State Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order, in such form and manner as may be prescribed. <br><br>

    APPEAL TO NATIONAL COMMISSION ONLY WHEN THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL QUESTION OF LAW IS INVOLVED IN THE MATTER. <br><br> 
    Section of 51(2) of the New Act provides that Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Act or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal shall lie to the National Commission from any order passed in appeal by any State Commission, if the National Commission is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law.
